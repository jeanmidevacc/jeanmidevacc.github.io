Hello reader , and welcome to my blog.

I am beginning today my blog/website for different reasons:
- Need of some kind of portfolio for my career/projects
- Refresh html knowledge
- Be the foundation for my Medium profile
- Nice coding project

Like I said I am currently a data scientist and my job since the beginning of my career (quite young) it's to develop solutions for smart grid/home/device projects (take a look on my [background](../../../../../about)).

In this blog I will mostly talk about digital stuff (surely more data oriented) and present some of my personal projects.

So if you have any remarks, questions don't hesitate to contact me.

I hope that you will enjoy the reading of my blog.

PS : By the way this website is hosting in Github , I am using the service [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with the framework [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the foundation of this blog is a git fork from the [repository](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) that I found after the reading of this [blog](https://iamtrask.github.io/).
