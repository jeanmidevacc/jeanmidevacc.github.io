I am beginning today my blog/website for different reasons:
- Need of some kind of portfolio for my career/projects
- Refresh html knowledge
- Be the foundation for my Medium profile
- Nice coding project

Like I said I am currently a data scientist and my job since the beginning of my career (quite young) it's to develop solutions for smart grid/home/device projects (take a look on my [background](www)).In this blog I will mostly talk about digital stuff (surely more data oriented) and present some of my personal projects.

So if you have any remarks, questions don't hesitate to contact me.

I hope that you will enjoy the reading of my blog.
