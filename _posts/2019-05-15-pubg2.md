For this article, I am going to start the analysis of the data extracted with the pipeline explained on this article. The goal of this [article](http://the-odd-dataguy.com/pubg1) is too:
* Get an introduction to AWS athena
* Get insights on the data by using plotly
* Better understand the consumption of the video game PUBG

# Athena AWS

Athena is the service developed by Amazon to give the possibility to someone to easily query data from a S3 bucket without using servers or data warehouses. There is an example of the interface to use Athena on a web browser.

The system developed is pretty open in terms of data format that can be used CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet.

The core of the system is build on [Presto](https://prestodb.github.io/) that is defined as an open source distributed SQL query engine. One of the main user of this project is [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/presto-interacting-with-petabytes-of-data-at-facebook/10151786197628920/) on various topics around interactive analytics, batch ETL, A/B testing and developer advertiser analytics.

There is a good [article](https://research.fb.com/publications/presto-sql-on-everything/) about Presto that is entering more in details on the all the machinery of the engine.

Some other big users of this tool are [Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/metacat-making-big-data-discoverable-and-meaningful-at-netflix-56fb36a53520) and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.io/projects/airpal/) that are building services around this kind of system.

If we go back to the Athena service, that arrived with the serverless system is the fact the billing is only based  data scanned. So really this combo S3  + Athena is a good mix for people who wants to handle a volume of data that can be consider “big” without handling all the infrastructure (that is a full time job).

To connect AWS Athena to a python script there is a package [pyathenajdbc](https://pypi.org/project/PyAthenaJDBC/) that can be installed and will install a connector that can be use in a pandas dataframe. There is an example of a script to connect the data.

Let’s start the analysis of the data associated to PUBG.

# Status on the data collected

The pipe ran during more than a month between the 26th january 2019 and the 5th April 2019, this amount of time represent around 69000 matches so that a pretty interesting volume of data to handle (with the amount of events collected during the match).

In terms of area and platform, the pipe was focused to extract the data from the PC platform in north america.

# Plotly and cufflinks

I am pretty big fan of plotly I did an [article](http://the-odd-dataguy.com/metricsdash) last year on their Shiny like python package call [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/), it’s really a cool package that make the building of dashboard more easier in Python.

Plotly is a really cool library to make interactive plot  but the syntax is a little bit long so there is people that have developed some plotly wrapper to facilitate the build a of a graph:
* Cufflinks developed by Jorge Santos (and many contributors)
* Plotly express developed by plotly themselves

For this article I have only used cufflinks but I am planning to make another article that will used plotly express.

# Let’s dive in PUBG

To be honest there is multiples websites than have done similar analysis like [pubgmap.io](https://pubgmap.io/) but it is still interesting to make different analysis and make some comparisons.

The mode that is the most popular is the squad one, and the map is Savage. For the following analysis , I am going to focus on the mode **squad**.

n term of duration , I took a sample of the match (1000 matches) for each map and there is some boxplots.
